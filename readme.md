The Game

This version of Battleships is played by 2 or more people. Each player has their
own grid with the ships randomly placed on the grid by the computer.

There is 1 battleship of 4 squares, a cruiser of 3 squares, a destroyer of
2 squares and 2 submarines of 1 square each.

Players take turns to find their ships. The player who bombs all their ships first
is the winner.

The Approach

I wanted to split the program based on functionality and used objects.
..* Player
..* Grid : Represents each players Grid which holds the ships
..* Ship : Holds the details of each ship
..* Ship Placer : Places the ships on the grid
..* Fleet : Holds onto how many ships and what types are being put into the grid
..* Viewer : Input and Output to the screen
..* Scorer : Holds onto the scores (How many ships have been blown up)
..* Manager : Directs the traffic

The above approach could be overkill but it made sense when designing the game
